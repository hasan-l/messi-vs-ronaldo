          <h3>Messi-Ronaldo rivalry</h3>
          <p>The Messi–Ronaldo rivalry is a supposed association football rivalry between Argentine forward Lionel Messi and Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo. Having won a combined eight FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, both Messi and Ronaldo are widely regarded as the best two players in the world of their generation, as well as being among the best of all time in the sport. Both players have scored in two UEFA Champions League finals, have regularly broken the 50 goal barrier in a single season, and have scored over 500 goals each in their careers for club and country. Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to establish who they believe is the best player in modern football It has been compared to legendary global sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Björn Borg–John McEnroe rivalry in tennis, and the Ayrton Senna–Alain Prost rivalry in Formula One motor racing.
          </p><br>

          <p>In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high", while Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson, opined that "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best". Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano". In response to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented; "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating; "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."</p>

           <h3>Origins</h3>
          <p>In 2007, Ronaldo and Messi finished as runners-up to A.C. Milan's Kaká in both the Ballon d'Or, an award rewarded to the player voted as the best in the world by an international panel of sports journalists, and the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year, an award voted for by coaches and captains of international teams. In an interview that year, Messi was quoted as saying "Cristiano Ronaldo is an extraordinary player and it would be brilliant to be in the same team as him".</p><br>
            
          <p>They first played in a game together when United were drawn to play Barcelona in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, and were immediately pitted as major rivals.Ronaldo missed a penalty in the first leg, but United eventually advanced to the final via a Paul Scholes goal. At the end of the year, Ronaldo was awarded the Ballon d'Or and vowed that he would win the award again.</p><br>

          <p>The 2009 UEFA Champions League Final was contested between United and Barcelona on 27 May 2009 at Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. The match, described as a "dream clash", was again hyped as the latest battle between the two, this time to settle who was the best player in the world; Ronaldo claimed he was the better of the two, while Messi's club-mate Xavi sided with him. United manager Alex Ferguson was more diplomatic, praising both players as being amongst the world's elite talents. Messi, playing in a central role he was unaccustomed to so he would avoid a direct battle with United left-back Patrice Evra, scored Barcelona's second in a 2–0 victory with a header in the 70th minute.Ronaldo, meanwhile, was subdued for much of the game despite some early chances to score, and his frustration eventually showed when he was booked for a rash tackle on Carles Puyol.
